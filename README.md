# 🎥 YouTube Analysis
### -- Cristine Huang

### 🎯 Purpose of this project
The background of the story of why I made this YouTube analysis was because I wanted to start my YouTube channel but I do not know what kind of YouTube channel I want to put to world and what is the people likes. So from there, I have an idea to make my own research through YouTube data which I got it from [kaggle](kaggle.com) . I want to see what kind of videos people usually see, what is the peak month(s), etc.

### 📊 Data Understanding
Data source: [Kaggle Youtube](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new/data)<br>
There are ten datasets YouTube that we can use. But in this case, I use Canada's dataset but you can change the data source you want. 

<br>
### 🚀 Future Improvement
For now, my analysis is limited only to descriptive analysis. For the future improvement I want to do more on the prediction analysis.
